1
00:00:8,300 --> 00:00:8,907
Хорошо.

2
00:00:8,907 --> 00:00:09,771
И снова здравствуйте.

3
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:14,373
Теперь у нас есть хорошя сцена но я думаю мы можем лучше.

4
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:19,700
В движке есть интересные вещи

5
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:21,840
и одну из них я вам сейчас покажу.

6
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,090
We'll start by learning the basics of Unreal Engine, how to maneuver throughout the viewport and manipulate

7
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:46,870
objects.

8
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:53,230
Well, then create a completely blank open world map and add lighting and sky and learn how these objects

9
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,310
work with each other.

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,770
We'll create a beautiful atmosphere for our world with two sons, and you're encouraged to customize

11
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,680
your sky, to get it to look exactly how you want.

12
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:09,070
We then learn how to add a landscape to our open world and sculpt hills and valleys and mountains,

13
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,880
then apply materials to get different biomes and environments.

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,180
With landscape painting, we'll learn the foliage editor and get realistic mega scan assets for free

15
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,980
from Pixel Bridge, a massive library of assets built into the engine.

16
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:30,280
And we'll add rocks, trees, grass and growth to create a beautiful forest in the middle of our open

17
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,450
world desert.

18
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,580
After world building, I teach you the basics of vectors and math for video games.
